        Calculates an instant insurance quote based on property details. 
        
        Returns either:
        - Standard quote with annual premium amount (if under $5,000/year)
        - Contact required message (if $5,000/year or higher)
        
        This endpoint performs the same calculation as the client-side JavaScript module.
